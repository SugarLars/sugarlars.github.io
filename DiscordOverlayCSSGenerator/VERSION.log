Notes v1.0

Notes v1.1
-New confirm dialog when generating css and no grid rows are marked.
-Added width and height columns to be able to resize each user images.
-Fixed some tooltips/messages.
Bugs fixed
-When displaying "Only generated users", the hidden avatars take html space and move the visible ones.

Notes v1.2
-New jump animations (all directions now available).
-New color modifiers "sepia" and "brightness reduced" when users not talking.
Bugs fixed
-When using "Custom positions", images keep a margin and don't start from the actual screen edge.

Notes v1.3
-Fields "Avatar size" and "Border speaking" now are always available. This way the default appearance of guest users (users not marked in the grid) can be configured.
-New field "Avatar margin" (always available too). Determines the separation between avatars when displayed horizontally or vertically (avatars with custom positions are not affected by this setting).
-New animation "Zoom".
-Tooltips updated.
Bugs fixed
-When placing images outside the canvas the browser shows scroll bars.

Notes v1.3b
-Animation "Zoom" renamed to "Zoom in". Animation "Zoom out" added.
-Border shape field now let's choose between circle or square Discord avatars.
-Fixed confusing behaviour when showing/hiding the grid columns regarding border color.
-Fields tab order fixed.

Notes v1.4
-New fields to set the top-left start position of the overlay (distance from the corner). The idea is to set the OBS layer to fill the whole screen and then control everything through this app.
-New checkbox column to hide specific users. Can be handy when, in example, a streamer doesn't want to appear themself in the overlay because they already have a webcam or a 3D avatar.
-New menu links to open the overlay website and open this discord channel to check for updates (yes, I'm lazy, I wanted something to click and go ðŸ˜…).

Notes v1.4b
-Avatars are always displayed regardless of users being silent or speaking. We can set the opacity to zero when silent, but avatars will still be rendered and will keep their position/order in the screen. Now it will be possible to choose the effect "No render" when users are silent. For the vertical/horizontal layout this means avatars will appear and stack up as people speak. Thus, the field "Colors" has been renamed to "Effect".

Notes v1.4c
-Added a label to remind people about tooltips.
-Tooltip messages updated to make things more clear.

Notes v1.5
-Field "Layout" now lets choose between vertical/horizontal and default/custom positions (until now the custom positions option forced the layout to be always vertical).
-New field "Layout position" to configure the screen corner where the overlay will be rendered.
-Fields rearranged (similar fields are now together, I think it looks a bit more natural).
-Added my avatar in the About popup, because :3

Notes v1.6
-Whole new section to configure discord names. Position (over/right/under/left the avatar), style (rectangle background, outline effect or nothing), margins, size and colors.
-Rest of fields moved/compacted.
-Removed color picker buttons (to access the popup just click the colored square).
-Removed color clear buttons.

Notes v1.6b
-Set the names opacity to "Opacity speaking" field value (due to widget limitation names don't change when speaking, so to try to keep visual consistency I'm setting them to that custom value instead of always 100%).
-Bonus: New looping/infinite animations added âœ¨ (I didn't want to add those because they can be really distracting, but the more variety the better I guess!).

Notes v1.7
-Added Reset menu option (in case someone wants to reset app to default values).
-Added Import and Export menu options (so now you can have your own backups, or share the config with another person).
-Load action (when app is open) and import action will compare the version of the file with the current app version and will alert the user if needed.

Notes v1.7b
-Amended About popup to remove references to my discord channel. From now on the latest version of the app can be downloaded from the GitHub website https://sugarlars.github.io/.

Notes v1.7c
-"Check updates" menu option now will actually check the GitHub website and compare version numbers.
-New "Copy" button added (duplicates rows).
-New column "Name" to choose whether to show/hide the name for each user.
-App performance improved (removed grid "X" clear buttons, enabled grid DoubleBuffering, always use grid AddRange() when populating).
-Grid max rows increased to 50.

Notes v1.7d
-When generating CSS, results will be presented in a popup (instead of directly copied to clipboard). This will avoid the random exception of clipboard being "locked" by another process.
-Load config file confirmation popup now will appear after the app has been rendered (for some reason popup was always displayed before the app).

Notes v1.7e
-Fixed newline character when displaying generated CSS result in the textarea (it was shown like one humongous single line).
-Popups (About and Result) now will appear centered in the app (it was annoying Windows placing them in random start positions).
-Press Escape key to close About and Result dialogs (God, why didn't I add this functionality before??).
-New "Reload" menu option to restore last internal save file (handy when opening a new version of the app, and it asks you if you want to load the previous version file, and you accidentally say no).
-Added Ctrl+S shortcut to save the form.

Notes v1.8
-New animation types.
-New fields animation "Duration" and animation "Quantity".
-New url image preview (just mouse over grid cells with image filenames).
-Removed effect type "Brightness" as it conflicted brightness animation types.
-Version added to final css paragraph to keep track of the last time you generated it.
-Added units labels everywhere.
-Some tooltips amended.
-Big generate button.

Notes v1.8a
-Fields "Layout X/Y" now include negative values. The idea is that the OBS layer takes the whole screen and you configure everything via this app ðŸ˜‰ (tip: hide partially all avatars and add a "Move" animation in the opposite direction so icons pop out like in a whack-a-mole game).
-Form is always saved in the internal file when closing the app. Now there will be a "Do you want to save changes?" confirmation message in case the form is dirty (this can be useful if you only wanted to test animations without having to import a backup file afterwards).
-Fixed a stupid CSS thing that made avatars float some pixels above their text or screen edge.
